description: |-
  Allows you to have a access to result during plan phase that states whether value marked as "(known after apply)" or not.
  Provider Metadata
  Each module can use providermeta. Please keep in mind that these settings only count for resources of this module! (see https://www.terraform.io/internals/provider-meta https://www.terraform.io/internals/provider-meta):
  ```terraform
  // Terraform providermeta example
  terraform {
      // "value" is the provider name
      providermeta "value" {
          // {workdir} -> The only available placeholder currently (see below for more information)
          guidseed_addition = "{workdir}#for-example" // Results into "/path/to/workdir#for-example"
      }
  }
  ```
  Optional
  guid_seed_addition (String) It serves as an guid seed addition to those resources that implement guid_seed as an attribute. But there are scopes you need to keep in mind: if guid_seed_addition has been specified in the provider block then top-level and nested modules are using the provider block seed addition. If guid_seed_addition has been specified in the providermeta block then only the resources of that module are using the module-level seed addition. Besides guid_seed, the provider block seed addition, the providermeta block seed addition and the resource type itself will become part of the final seed.
  Placeholders:
  "{workdir}" (Keyword) The actual workdir; equals to terraform's path.root. This placeholder is
  recommended because this value won't be dragged along the plan and apply phase in comparison to
  "abspath(path.root)" that you would add to resource seed where a change to path.root would be
  recognized just as usual from terraform.

# value_is_known (Resource)

Allows you to have a access to `result` during plan phase that states whether `value` marked as "(known after apply)" or not.
## Provider Metadata
Each module can use provider_meta. Please keep in mind that these settings only count for resources of this module! (see [https://www.terraform.io/internals/provider-meta](https://www.terraform.io/internals/provider-meta)):
```terraform
// Terraform provider_meta example
terraform {
	// "value" is the provider name
	provider_meta "value" {
		// {workdir} -> The only available placeholder currently (see below for more information)
		guid_seed_addition = "{workdir}#for-example" // Results into "/path/to/workdir#for-example"
	}
}
```
### Optional
- `guid_seed_addition` (String) It serves as an guid seed addition to those resources that implement `guid_seed` as an attribute. But there are scopes you need to keep in mind: if `guid_seed_addition` has been specified in the provider block then top-level and nested modules are using the provider block seed addition. If `guid_seed_addition` has been specified in the provider_meta block then only the resources of that module are using the module-level seed addition. Besides `guid_seed`, the provider block seed addition, the provider_meta block seed addition and the resource type itself will become part of the final seed.

	**Placeholders**:
	- "{workdir}" (Keyword) The actual workdir; equals to terraform's path.root. This placeholder is
	recommended because this value won't be dragged along the plan and apply phase in comparison to
	"abspath(path.root)" that you would add to resource seed where a change to path.root would be
	recognized just as usual from terraform.

## Schema

### Required

- `guid_seed` (String) Attention! The seed is being used to determine resource uniqueness prior (first plan phase) and during apply phase (second plan phase). Very important to state is that the **seed must be fully known during the plan phase**, otherwise, an error is thrown. Within one terraform plan & apply the **seed of every "value_is_known" must be unique**! I really recommend you to use the provider configuration and/or provider_meta configuration to increase resource uniqueness. Besides `guid_seed`, the provider block seed addition, the provider_meta block seed addition and the resource type itself will become part of the final seed. Under certain circumstances you may face problems if you run terraform concurrenctly. If you do so, then I recommend you to pass-through a random value via a user (environment) variable that you then add to the seed.
- `proposed_unknown` (Dynamic) It is very crucial that this field is **not** filled by any custom value except the one produced by `value_unknown_proposer` (resource). This has the reason as its `value` is **always** unknown during the plan phase. On this behaviour this resource must rely and it cannot check if you do not so!
- `value` (Dynamic) The `value` (not nested attributes) is test against "(known after apply)"

### Optional

- `result` (Boolean) States whether `value` is marked as "(known after apply)" or not. If `value` is an aggregate type, only the top level of the aggregate type is checked; elements and attributes are not checked.
