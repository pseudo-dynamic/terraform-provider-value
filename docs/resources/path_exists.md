# value_path_exists (Resource)

Checks if an OS path exists and caches its computation at plan-time and won't change afterapply-time even the path may have been removed.
## Provider Metadata
Each module can use provider_meta. Please keep in mind that these settings only count for resources of this module! (see [https://www.terraform.io/internals/provider-meta](https://www.terraform.io/internals/provider-meta)):
```terraform
// Terraform provider_meta example
terraform {
	// "value" is the provider name
	provider_meta "value" {
		// {workdir} -> The only available placeholder currently (see below for more information)
		guid_seed_addition = "{workdir}#for-example" // Results into "/path/to/workdir#for-example"
	}
}
```
### Optional
- `guid_seed_addition` (String) It serves as addition to each seed of any `value_is_fully_known` (resource) or `value_is_known` (resource) within the project if specified in provider, or within the same module if specified in provider-meta.

	**Placeholders**:
	- "{workdir}" (Keyword) The actual workdir; equals to terraform's path.root. This placeholder is
	recommended because this value won't be dragged along the plan and apply phase in comparison to
	"abspath(path.root)" that you would add to resource seed where a change to path.root would be
	recognized just as usual from terraform.

## Schema

### Required

- `guid_seed` (String) Attention! The seed is being used to determine resource uniqueness prior (first plan phase) and during apply phase (second plan phase). Very important to state is that the **seed must be fully known during the plan phase**, otherwise, an error is thrown. Within one terraform plan & apply the **seed of every "value_path_exists" must be unique**! I really recommend you to use the provider configuration and/or provider_meta configuration to increase resource uniqueness. Besides `guid_seed`, the provider configuration seed, the provider_meta configuration seed and the resource type itself will become part of the final seed. Under certain circumstances you may face problems if you run terraform concurrenctly. If you do so, then I recommend you to pass-through a random value via a user (environment) variable that you then add to the seed.
- `path` (String) A path to a file or directory.
- `proposed_unknown` (Boolean) It is very crucial that this field is **not** filled by any custom value except the one produced by `value_unknown_proposer` (resource). This has the reason as its `value` is **always** unknown during the plan phase. On this behaviour this resource must rely and it cannot check if you do not so!

### Read-Only

- `exists` (Boolean) The computation whether the path exists or not.
