# value Provider





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `guid_seed_addition` (String) It serves as addition to each seed of any `value_is_fully_known` (resource) or `value_is_known` (resource) within the project if specified in provider, or within the same module if specified in provider-meta.

	**Placeholders**:
	- "{workdir}" (Keyword) The actual workdir; equals to terraform's path.root. This placeholder is
	recommended because this value won't be dragged along the plan and apply phase in comparison to
	"abspath(path.root)" that you would add to resource seed where a change to path.root would be
	recognized just as usual from terraform.
