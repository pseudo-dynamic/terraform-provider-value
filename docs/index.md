# value Provider





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `guid_seed_addition` (String) It serves as an guid seed addition to those resources that implement `guid_seed` as an attribute. But there are scopes you need to keep in mind: if `guid_seed_addition` has been specified in the provider block then top-level and nested modules are using the provider block seed addition. If `guid_seed_addition` has been specified in the provider_meta block then only the resources of that module are using the module-level seed addition. Besides `guid_seed`, the provider block seed addition, the provider_meta block seed addition and the resource type itself will become part of the final seed.

	**Placeholders**:
	- "{workdir}" (Keyword) The actual workdir; equals to terraform's path.root. This placeholder is
	recommended because this value won't be dragged along the plan and apply phase in comparison to
	"abspath(path.root)" that you would add to resource seed where a change to path.root would be
	recognized just as usual from terraform.
